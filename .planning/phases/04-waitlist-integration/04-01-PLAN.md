<objective>
Update waitlist form copy for exclusivity framing and verify the full cinematic-to-signup experience works end-to-end.

Purpose: Phase 3 already wired the form into the cinematic sequence as the climax beat. This plan completes the waitlist integration by replacing generic copy ("ENTER", "We'll be in touch.") with exclusivity-framed language that converts curiosity into signups.

Output: Production-ready waitlist flow with exclusivity CTA, verified end-to-end.

  <name>Task 1: Update form copy for exclusivity framing</name>
  <files>app/components/HomepageSignup.tsx, app/globals.css</files>
  <action>
    Update HomepageSignup.tsx with exclusivity-framed copy:

    1. CTA button text: Change "ENTER" to "GET EARLY ACCESS" — this frames the signup as exclusive/limited, not a generic form submission.

    2. Loading state text: Change "..." to "JOINING..." — active, anticipatory language.

    3. Success message: Change "We'll be in touch." to "You're on the list." — immediate confirmation with exclusive insider framing. Keep it short and confident.

    4. In globals.css, adjust `.mystery-submit` styling if needed — the button text is longer now ("GET EARLY ACCESS" vs "ENTER"), so verify padding and font-size still look balanced. The button should feel bold and clickable, not cramped. May need to reduce letter-spacing slightly for the longer text.

    Do NOT change: form fields (name/email), validation logic, API endpoint, form structure, animation timing, or any other component.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run build` succeeds without errors
    - HomepageSignup.tsx contains "GET EARLY ACCESS" as button text
    - HomepageSignup.tsx contains "You're on the list." as success message
    - HomepageSignup.tsx contains "JOINING..." as loading state
  </verify>
  <done>
    Form CTA says "GET EARLY ACCESS", loading says "JOINING...", success says "You're on the list." Build passes.

  <what-built>
    Exclusivity-framed waitlist form as the climax of the cinematic sequence. The full experience: pain-point escalation → STREET reveal → "Coming to London." → waitlist form with "GET EARLY ACCESS" CTA.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Clear localStorage: open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage → delete `street-visited` key
    2. Run: `npm run dev`
    3. Visit: http://localhost:3000
    4. Watch the full cinematic sequence play (~11 seconds):
       - "3-day delivery." → "Next-day delivery." → "Same-day delivery." → "Not fast enough."
       - STREET logo appears with neon glow
       - "Coming to London." fades in
       - Waitlist form fades in with "GET EARLY ACCESS" button
    5. Verify button says "GET EARLY ACCESS" (not "ENTER" or "Submit")
    6. Enter a test name and email, click "GET EARLY ACCESS"
    7. Verify button changes to "JOINING..." while loading
    8. Verify success message shows "You're on the list." after submission
    9. Refresh the page — should skip sequence and show brand + form immediately (returning visitor)
    10. Check that the button sizing and spacing look balanced with the longer CTA text
