<objective>
Transform the homepage CSS from flat black-and-white to a dark cinematic aesthetic with neon green accents.

Purpose: Establish the visual palette that makes the page feel intentional and atmospheric rather than broken/unfinished. The neon glow creates the sense that something electric is happening.
Output: Updated mystery-* CSS classes with radial gradient background, neon text-shadow on logo, glow effects on form elements.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Apply dark cinematic palette and neon accents to mystery-* CSS</name>
  <files>app/globals.css</files>
  <action>
    Update the MYSTERY LANDING PAGE section (lines ~1832-1969) of globals.css:

    1. **mystery-container**: Replace flat `background: #000` with subtle radial gradient that hints at neon glow from center:
       `background: radial-gradient(ellipse at 50% 40%, rgba(198, 255, 0, 0.03) 0%, #000 70%);`
       The 0.03 opacity is barely perceptible but creates atmospheric depth.

    2. **mystery-logo**: Replace the current white text-shadow with a neon green glow:
       `text-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(198, 255, 0, 0.3), 0 0 60px rgba(198, 255, 0, 0.1), 0 0 100px rgba(198, 255, 0, 0.05);`
       Three layers: tight glow, medium spread, wide ambient. Keep `color: #fff` for the text itself.

    3. **mystery-tagline**: Keep the muted white `color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)` — the tagline should recede, not compete with the logo glow. No changes needed.

    4. **mystery-input:focus**: Add neon glow on focus state:
       `box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(198, 255, 0, 0.08);`
       Existing `border-color: var(--primary)` already turns neon green — the glow amplifies it.

    5. **mystery-submit**: Add subtle ambient glow:
       `box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(198, 255, 0, 0.15);`

    6. **mystery-submit:hover:not(:disabled)**: Enhance hover glow, change from white hover to staying neon:
       Replace `background: #fff` with `background: #d4ff33;` (brighter neon) and add:
       `box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(198, 255, 0, 0.4);`
       Keep the `transform: translateY(-2px)`.

    **DO NOT** change the reduced-motion block at the bottom — the existing overrides (text-shadow: none, background: #0a0a0a) are correct. The neon glow text-shadow is static CSS (not animation) but removing it for reduced-motion keeps the experience clean, which is the right call from Phase 1.

    **DO NOT** add any new animations or transitions beyond what already exists. Phase 2 is about static visual atmosphere, not motion.

    - mystery-logo has multi-layer neon green text-shadow
    - mystery-container has subtle radial gradient (not flat black)
    - mystery-input:focus has neon glow box-shadow
    - mystery-submit has ambient glow, hover state uses brighter neon
    - Reduced-motion block unchanged and still overrides neon glow
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify build, types, lint, and reduced-motion compatibility</name>
  <files>app/globals.css</files>
  <action>
    Run verification commands. Specifically check:

    1. `npm run build` — must succeed, homepage still statically prerendered
    2. `npm run lint` — no new errors in app/ files (pre-existing legacy warnings are acceptable)
    3. Verify the reduced-motion block still contains: .mystery-static display:none, .mystery-flash-image display:none, .mystery-container background: #0a0a0a, .mystery-logo text-shadow: none

    If any verification fails, fix the issue in globals.css before proceeding.
  </action>
  <verify>All three checks pass. Reduced-motion block confirmed intact.</verify>
