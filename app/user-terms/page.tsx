              <h2>1. Scope and Subject Matter of the Contract</h2>
              <p>
                The website STREET.LONDON and the app "STREET" (collectively referred to as the "Platform") constitute an online marketplace for connected retail. STREET Ltd, company number 16248225, registered office at Flat 62 Sutherland Avenue, W9 2QU London (hereinafter referred to as "STREET" or "we") and other commercial Retailers offer their products in their own name and for their own account. This reflects our commitment to STREET by providing an integrated marketplace experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                These general terms and conditions (hereinafter: "GTC") apply to all contracts concluded between STREET and other commercial Retailers on the platform (STREET and other Retailers hereinafter collectively referred to as "Retailers") and you (the "Customer" or "you") via the platform. If you do not accept the GTC, you are not permitted to use the platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                The platform is aimed exclusively at consumers. A consumer is any natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes that are predominantly neither commercial nor independent professional activity. All Retailers represented on the platform are entrepreneurs in the legal sense. An entrepreneur is a natural or legal person, or a partnership with legal capacity, who, when entering into a legal transaction, acts in the exercise of their commercial or independent professional activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The version of the General Terms and Conditions valid at the time of conclusion of the respective contract shall apply.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deviating terms and conditions of the customer will not be accepted. This also applies if the customer refers to these terms and conditions in statements and does not expressly object to their inclusion.

              <h2>2. Our Services and Your Use of Them</h2>
              <p>
                STREET offers you the opportunity to order everyday items from various Retailers on the platform in selected UK cities within the delivery areas available on the platform at the time of ordering. This embodies our forward-thinking retail approach, or Future of Retail.
              </p>
              <p>
                To shop at STREET, you must first create a user account. To do so, you must register with your name, phone number, and email address. Before placing an order, you must provide a delivery address. Customers can store multiple delivery addresses. The customer is responsible for ensuring that the information they provide is always up-to-date and accurate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The customer shall ensure that unauthorised persons do not gain access to the device used to place the order and/or the data required to place the order via the customer's user account. If the customer violates this obligation, the customer shall be liable for all activities originating from their user account that are caused by this breach of obligation, unless the customer is not responsible for them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Customer is prohibited from (i) using or attempting to use another person's User Account and/or accessing or using another person's personal payment information, (ii) creating a User Account using a false identity or another person's identity, or (iii) accessing the Platform by any means other than the means provided by STREET.
              </p>
              <p>The customer will inform STREET immediately upon becoming aware of any unauthorised use of his user account.</p>
              <p>STREET endeavours to ensure the continuous accessibility of the app, but assumes no liability for its permanent availability.</p>

              <h2>3. Conclusion of Contract</h2>
              <p>
                The purchase contract(s) is/are concluded between the customer and the seller of the goods ordered by the customer. The respective seller of an item is displayed at various points during the ordering process, in particular on the item details page, in the shopping cart, and before completing the order. If the contract is concluded with a seller other than STREET, we merely act as the intermediary between the customer and the seller and deliver the goods. In this case, all customer claims are directed against the respective seller.
              </p>
              <p>
                The customer is presented with a selection of goods on the platform. This display does not constitute an offer to conclude a purchase contract on the part of the seller. The customer can place the displayed items in their shopping cart. Placing goods in the shopping cart does not constitute a purchase contract between the customer and the seller.
              </p>
              <p>
                By submitting the order (pressing the "order with payment" button) by the customer, the customer submits a binding offer to the seller to conclude a purchase contract for the goods contained in his shopping cart.
              </p>
              <p>
                STREET will then automatically send the customer a confirmation of receipt via the platform, confirming receipt of the order by STREET. This confirmation of receipt does not constitute a purchase contract (neither with STREET nor with the respective seller). Rather, STREET merely confirms receipt of the customer's declaration of intent to conclude a purchase contract.
              </p>
              <p>
                A binding purchase contract for the respective goods is concluded with the order confirmation sent to the customer via the platform or at the time the payment transaction is processed by our service provider or the selected payment service provider. The time of execution of the payment transaction depends on the selected payment method. The relevant alternative for the conclusion of the contract depends on which of the listed events occurs first.
              </p>
              <p>The purchase contract is only concluded with the seller named in the order confirmation and the goods named in the order confirmation.</p>
              <p>Customers can only order goods via the platform in quantities typical for household use.</p>
              <p>
                If goods that the customer has bindingly ordered (i.e., those listed in the order confirmation) should not be available, the respective seller reserves the right to withdraw. In this case, the customer will be informed immediately, the order will be (partially) cancelled, and any purchase price already paid for the affected goods will be refunded via the respective payment method. If a voucher was used for the order, STREET will refund the voucher in the amount of the unavailable goods. Otherwise, Section 14 of these Terms and Conditions applies.
              </p>
              <p>The goods ordered via the platform remain the property of the seller until they have been paid for in full.</p>

              <p>
                Payment can be made by credit card, PayPal, or the payment methods stored by the customer with the respective provider as part of a single sign-on process.

              <h2>7. Delivery and Delivery Times</h2>
              <p>After a successful order from a seller via the platform, STREET delivers the ordered goods to the customer.</p>
              <p>
                Subject to local or temporary restrictions and depending on the opening hours of the respective seller's retail store (hereinafter "Store"), STREET delivers daily, excluding Sundays and public holidays. STREET strives to deliver orders within the delivery period selected by the customer, but does not guarantee the exact delivery time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Delivery will be made to the delivery address provided by the customer when placing the order. The customer is solely responsible for providing a complete and correct delivery address and, if necessary, further instructions for the delivery of orders placed via the STREET platform. The customer must be reachable at the telephone number provided for delivery calls. If the customer cannot be reached at the specified address or telephone number, STREET will only leave the ordered goods at the specified address without delivery if the customer has expressly selected this option during the ordering process. Otherwise, if the customer cannot be reached at the delivery address within ten minutes of the delivery of the ordered goods and the delivery cannot be completed even after two contact attempts by the courier, the respective seller may withdraw from the purchase contract. The seller is entitled to claim the costs incurred from the customer.

              <h2>8. Customer Rights in the Event of Defects</h2>
              <p>
                With regard to goods ordered on the platform, the respective seller is liable for material and legal defects in accordance with statutory provisions. If you have been granted a seller's guarantee, the details can be found in the guarantee terms and conditions enclosed with the respective delivered goods, fulfilling our promise of fireWarranty. Warranty claims exist without prejudice to statutory claims/rights.
              </p>
              <p>Any claims by the customer for damages due to material and legal defects are subject to the restrictions in Section 16 of these General Terms and Conditions.</p>
              <p>
                If the packaging is damaged upon delivery, we recommend that you refuse delivery and inform the STREET courier accordingly. If you only discover a defect in the delivered goods after opening the packaging, please contact us before returning the goods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please first contact our customer service, which you can reach either by email at <a href="mailto:hi@street.london" className="contact-link">hi@street.london</a> or via the chat function ("Contact us") in the app. The quickest and easiest way for us to process your complaint is if you have a photo of the product you are complaining about ready or send it with your complaint. If our customer service is unable to resolve the issue, we will contact the relevant seller if necessary.

              <h2>9. Returns</h2>
              <p>
                Returns of orders placed via the platform will be processed by a STREET courier picking up the goods from the delivery address or returned by the user to the retailer. If the customer chooses to have the goods picked up by STREET, possible dates and time slots (2 hours each) for picking up the goods by a STREET courier will be displayed on the platform after the customer has selected the appropriate time slot and confirms the return. During the selected time period, the customer or a person designated by them must be present at the delivery address provided by them and hand over the returned goods to the STREET courier. Until the goods are handed over to the STREET courier, the customer is liable for any damage, loss, or accidental destruction of the goods. There is a 14-day cooling-off period, after which you can return items for a full refund. There are retailers that may have longer periods, please see store return policy for more details.
              </p>
              <p>To ensure a seamless return experience, please adhere to the following guidelines.</p>
              <p>
                All merchandise must be returned in a pristine, unused state, exhibiting no signs of wear, damage, or alteration. Items must be returned with all original protective materials intact and with the STREET and designer labels, if applicable, still affixed. This encompasses all original packaging, accessories, and authenticity cards or dust bags. STREET retains the right to refuse any return where the product displays indications of use or has been modified from its original condition, or, alternatively, may reduce the applicable refund or exchange to reflect the diminished value.
              </p>
              <p>Potential reasons for a refund reduction include, but are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The product(s) have been used, worn, damaged, or washed.</li>
                <li>The STREET and designer label are not attached to the product(s) or have not been returned. These labels are considered an essential component of each product.</li>
                <li>Any original packaging essential to the product's value, such as a dust bag, is not included in the return.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You will be notified should we propose a reduction to your refund for any of the reasons outlined above. As an alternative to a reduced refund, you may elect to have the product(s) returned to you at your own expense.
              </p>

              <h3>Bags & Accessories</h3>
              <p>All designer packaging, including authenticity cards, dust bags, and leather tags, must accompany your return.</p>
              <p>When handling light-coloured bags and accessories, exercise caution if you are undecided about keeping the item. Please be aware that dark-coloured clothing can transfer dye to light-coloured items.</p>

              <h3>Shoes</h3>
              <p>When trying on shoes, we recommend doing so on a carpeted surface to prevent damage to the soles. Please return all components, including the dust bag and shoebox. The shoebox is an integral part of the product; ensure it is returned intact and protected within additional outer packaging. Returns that do not meet these conditions will not be accepted.</p>

              <h3>Beauty, Fragrance & Candles</h3>
              <p>Skincare, cosmetics, and haircare products must be returned unused, unopened, and in their original packaging. Due to transport regulations, please note that fragrance, nail polish, candles, and aerosols are final sale items and cannot be returned.</p>

              <h3>Lingerie & Swimwear</h3>
              <p>For hygiene reasons, briefs, swimsuits, and bikini bottoms should be tried on over underwear, without removing the protective adhesive strip.</p>

              <h3>Fine Jewellery</h3>
              <p>These exquisite items must be returned unworn, along with the presentation box, protective packaging, and any STREET/designer cards or labels originally included.</p>

              <h3>Luxury Watches</h3>
              <p>Luxury watches must be returned unworn, with the plastic protective cover still affixed to the watch face, and in the original packaging, inclusive of the warranty, presentation box, and any outer packaging. Please also ensure that the watch has not been wound to set the time. Any watch bracelets that have been adjusted must be returned with the exact number of links that were included in the original delivery.</p>

              <h3>Limited Edition Products & Books</h3>
              <p>Given the collectible nature of these items, please refrain from removing the protective cover and packaging unless you are certain you wish to keep the product.</p>

              <h3>Technology</h3>
              <p>Technology products must be returned in their original packaging.</p>

              <h3>Gift Returns</h3>
              <p>For assistance with gift returns, please contact us via email.</p>

              <h3>Late Returns</h3>
              <p>Returns must be initiated within 28 days of the original delivery date. Returns received after this period may be accepted at the discretion of STREET and, if approved, may only be refunded as store credit.</p>

              <h3>Colours</h3>
              <p>We have undertaken every effort to accurately represent the colours of our products as they appear on the STREET platform. However, due to variations in computer monitors, tablets, and mobile devices, we cannot guarantee that the colour displayed on your device will precisely match the actual product colour.</p>

              <h2>12. Vouchers</h2>
              <p>
                Vouchers issued by STREET ("STREET Voucher") that grant certain discounts can be redeemed via the platform. A STREET Voucher can only be redeemed once. The applicable voucher terms and conditions (e.g., voucher validity period, minimum order quantities, goods for which the voucher is valid, etc.) will be displayed to the customer before receiving the STREET Voucher. The customer has no entitlement to the granting of STREET Vouchers.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a STREET voucher is used to order multiple items, the discount granted by the voucher will be distributed proportionally among the individual items. In the event of a return of orders for which a STREET voucher was used, only the purchase price actually paid by the customer will be refunded—that is, the price of the respective items minus the (proportional) discount provided by the STREET voucher.
              </p>
              <p>Vouchers cannot be redeemed for cash. Unused discounts will not be refunded. Combining multiple vouchers is also not possible.</p>
              <p>If the customer's use of vouchers violates the respective voucher terms and conditions, STREET or the issuing seller is entitled to revoke the voucher and not grant the respective discount.</p>
              <p>Vouchers do not apply to goods with fixed prices (such as books or magazines).</p>
              <p>Vouchers from other Retailers may not be usable on the platform.</p>

              </p>
              <p>STREET may terminate the contractual relationship with the Customer with regard to its user account with a notice period of two (2) weeks by email to the email address provided by the Customer in the user account.</p>
              <p>Orders not yet processed remain unaffected by termination in accordance with Section 15.</p>
              <p>The statutory right of termination for good cause remains unaffected.</p>
